## 🚀 About the Project

Refund is a simple web application that allows users to submit reimbursement requests and keep track of their expenses.

This project was built to practice JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, form handling, data validation, and local storage. It also introduces the basics of dynamic interfaces by rendering lists and managing user inputs.

The main goal was to simulate a real-world workflow for expense tracking, reinforcing my understanding of front-end logic with JavaScript.

In future iterations, I intend to improve the UI, add data persistence with a backend service, and implement features like filtering and editing expenses.
